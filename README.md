# The Things Network: Intel Edison + iC880A - based gateway
##### __________________________________________________________
## - work in progress !
#### Current status:
#### 1. The installer works just fine. Also the start.sh file does its thing.
#### 2. On Edison, the hardware (SPI interface) doesn't respond well, preventing the iC880-A to start properly.
#### 3. The SPI misbehavior is due to well-known Yocto distro issues that have been duly reported to Intel, but not fixed yet.
### 4. To whom might be interested in fixing the distro issue: please let me know if or when it's fixed, so that I can verify on the Edison! Thanks in advance.
##### __________________________________________________________
Reference setup for [The Things Network](http://thethingsnetwork.org/) gateways based on the iC880a SPI concentrator with a IntelÂ® Edison Kit for Arduino as host.

This installer targets the **SPI version** of the board. The **USB** version is **not supported**

## Setup
- Connect the iC880a-SPI board to the Arduino [as shown in this picture](images/Connexions.jpg)
- Note: If you want to use also the [Grove base shield](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Base_shield_v2), do NOT use the Grove connector D8, as it is connected to the iC880! Also i2c functionality is disabled.
- Recommended voltage-level shifter: [TXB0108](http://www.ti.com/product/TXB0108)
- Detailed instructions will follow soon. 

## Installation
##### 1. If you haven't done so already:
 - 1.1 Flash your Edison with the latest Yocto image [as explained here] (https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/hardware/edison/downloads)
 - 1.2 install git [as explained here](https://github.com/w4ilun/edison-guides/wiki/Installing-Git-on-Intel-Edison)
 - 1.3 Login as root - this gives you all the necessary rights. No sudo available on Edison

##### 2. Clone the installer and start the installation

       git clone https://github.com/mihaimiculescu/TTN-ic880a-edison-gateway.git/ ~/TTN-ic880a-edison-gateway
       cd ~/TTN-ic880a-edison-gateway
       git checkout spi
       ./install.sh

## Update

If you have a running gateway and want to update, simply run the installer again:

         cd ~/TTN-ic880a-edison-gateway
         ./install.sh
